# Odd or Even Number Checker (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple Python program that prompts the user to enter a number and determines whether the number is **odd or even**.  
The project is designed to practice basic Python concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and error handling.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- PyCharm IDE

---

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. The program asks the user to enter a number.
2. It checks whether the number is divisible by 2.
3. If the remainder is 0, the number is **even**.
4. Otherwise, the number is **odd**.
5. The program handles invalid inputs gracefully.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Open the project in **PyCharm** (or any Python IDE).
2. Run the file `odd_even_checker.py`.
3. Enter a whole number when prompted.
4. View the result in the console.

## 🧪 Example Output
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number.


---

## 🚫 Error Handling
If the user enters invalid input (e.g. text instead of a number), the program displays a friendly error message instead of crashing.

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Python basics
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)
- User input handling
- Exception handling (`try/except`)
- Writing clean and readable code

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Allow the user to check multiple numbers
- Add a loop to keep the program running until the user exits
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
